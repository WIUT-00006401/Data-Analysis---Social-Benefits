A renowned presence not only in the European Union, but also across the world in providing extra-ordinary measures in the benefits, amenities and opportunities for all people regardless of ethnicity, age, religion or gender. However, even in the defined age of AI, data-driven decision making and data-reach on a global scale, majority of public records and performances are hidden from the public while it‚Äôs disclosure is at the discretion of news agencies, political campaigns and global event of scale.
